OVERVIEW:
    This version of PirateBox comes with a shoutbox interface that facilitates anonymous chat. 
    Like the original version, it also includes a simple file sharing interface. 
    NOTE: the shoutbox is based on JWC's PyShoutOut  http://jwcxz.com/projects/pyshoutout/ 
    The shoutbox files are stored in the /chat directory
    
PLEASE HELP:
  - This version needs testing. Please provide feedback on the PirateBox Forum:
    http://forum.daviddarts.com  

REQUIREMENTS:
  - USB 2.0 Drive
  - Seagate Dockstar (or GoFlex Net or Pogoplug device)
  - Wireless router that supports WRT firmware (DD-WRT, OpenWrt, etc)
  - Computer running Linux or Linux live CD (e.g. Ubuntu Live CD) 

PRE-INSTALL (ONLY NEEDED FOR "FRESH" DOCKSTAR/GOFLEX/POGOPLUG DEVICES):
  - NOTE: If you are you using a brand new Dockstar/Go Flex/Pogoplug device, you must first 
    update the locked uBoot boot loader with a new ulocked version that provides support for 
    booting from USB drives. Jeff Doozan has created an easy to use script for this.
    The login is root and default password is: stxadmin (ceadmin for Pogoplugs) 
    http://jeff.doozan.com/debian/uboot/ 

    As an alternative, you can use another script by Jeff Doozan's http://jeff.doozan.com/debian/
    to install Debian on a USB drive connected to the Dockstar/GoFlex/Pogoplug. This
    will install an updated uBoot bootloader which supports booting from USB devices.

INSTALL:
  - Format USB drive with 3 partitions:
	ext2 (minimum 500MB) (label: piratebox)
	swap (minimum 256MB) (no label)
  	FAT32 (label: share)
    NOTE: I recommend using GParted
    http://gparted.sourceforge.net
  - On Ubuntu, you can install with:
       sudo apt-get install gparted      
  - You can create and run a live CD or USB version of GParted. You can also use a Live Ubuntu CD 
    which comes with GParted pre-installed.
  - Mount USB drive on your computer
  - Download the tar.gz disk image to your computer
        wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/downloads/daviddarts/PirateBox/piratebox_0.3-4.tar.gz
  - Become super user:
	sudo su
  - Uncompress into the ext2 partition on the USB drive:  
	tar xvpfz piratebox_0.3-4.tar.gz --strip-components 1 -C /media/piratebox
  - Exit super user:
	exit
  - Create "piratebox" directory on the /media/share (FAT32) partition
	mkdir /media/share/piratebox  
  - Navigate to piratebox directory
	cd /media/share/piratebox
  - Add the following six files to the piratebox directory
	wget http://daviddarts.com/piratebox/.READ.ME.htm
	wget http://daviddarts.com/piratebox/.BACK.TO.MENU.htm
        wget http://daviddarts.com/piratebox/piratebox-logo-small.png
        wget http://daviddarts.com/piratebox/piratebox-logo.png
        wget http://daviddarts.com/piratebox/favicon.ico
        wget http://stackp.online.fr/wp-content/uploads/webserver.py
  - Unmount USB Drive using your file manager - Important: allow the system to "write" any extra data 
    to the drive first before unplugging (be patient!)
 
USAGE:
 - Connect USB Drive to the back port of the Dockstar (beside the ethernet port) and connect the 
    Dockstart to your DD-WRT router - see DIY Tutorial 2 on the wiki for more info: 
   http://wiki.daviddarts.com/PirateBox_DIY
  - Open a web browser and navigate to any web page - you should be redirected to 
   the main PirateBox menu page. Begin chatting and/or sharing files.
   NOTE: The hostname for the system is piratebox and the default password is root
   NOTE: If you would later like to use this USB disk image on another device, be sure to comment out
   the lines in the /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules file.
